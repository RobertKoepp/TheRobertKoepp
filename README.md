# TheRobertKoepp

TheRoberKoepp is a three page HTML project that includes a index, contact, and portfolio. 
The index is a basic background information on Robert Koepp, including his current employment, residence, and course that he is actively participating in. 
The contact page is a page where users can write and submit a message. 
The portfolio page consists of six pictures of the beautiful Lake Tahoe, the place where Robert Koepp currently resides. 
Each page includes a Navbar located at the top of the webpage. This Nav bar will help users navigate between the three HTML pages.
